    "It is a collection of labeled images of 12 different sports. \n",
    "For simplicity and for saving computational resources, we decide to only train for three sports, e.g. `tennis`, `football` and `weight_lifting`. However, more categories can be employed by modifying the `LABELS` object below. \n",
    "We also set the input parameters such as paths where to save and load the objects, and the number of federated learning rounds to run. Moreover, we can set the boolean parameter `train_network` to either train the federated neural network, or use a pre-trained model:"

    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "The goal of the present notebook is to train a neural network for video classification in the **federated context** using Sherpa FL framework. \n",
    "It is shown that the procedure is straightforward using the framework classes.\n",
    "In this experiment, the network is trained on images (not videos), thus not taking into account any spatial-temporal information. \n",
    "More advanced approaches can be used when training over videos (see e.g. [Karpathy et al., 2014](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42455.pdf) and [Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2199.pdf)).\n",
    "However, the only difference with respect what exposed in the present notebook would consist in setting up and training the local model, while the straightforward creation of the federated experiment with Sherpa FL framework would be exactly the same."
